# Bulbdial Clock Board

Board for the bulbdial clock developed at
[Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories](http://www.evilmadscientist.com/2009/a-bulbdial-clock/).
Due to current availability of only attiny45's the multiplexing is partly outsourced with
one 7bit binary counter (HEF4024B) and two 8bit addressable latches (HCF4724B).

For synchronization the board is equipped with a socket for a pollin DCF77 module (810 054).
