# Bulbdial Clock Board

Board for the bulbdial clock developed at [Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories](http://www.evilmadscientist.com/2009/a-bulbdial-clock/).
Due to current availability of only attiny45's the multiplexing is partly outsourced with one 7bit binary counter (HEF4024B) and two 8bit addressable latches (HCF4724B).
